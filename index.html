      <p>It was code named "BlueStar" in 2007 in the original business plan.</p> <br>
      
      <p>The car costs about €35000.</p> <br>
      
      <p>The car can go 0-60(0-97 km) in 5.6 seconds. The cars top speed in 130 mph(210 kmph). </p> <br>
      
      <p> Tesla’s operating system is built on a modified version of Linux Ubuntu. Musk says that Tesla aims to upgrade the Linux OS to 4.4 in Tesla vehicles in December. That’s when he expects they will be able to update the browser. <p> <br>

      <p> Tesla Inc. probably will pull off average reliability with the Model 3 sedan Elon Musk is counting on to dramatically expand demand for his electric cars, according to Consumer Reports magazine.</p>

      <h1>Intel</h1>

      <p>Intel are creating the infotainment system for the car.</p> <br>
    
     
      <p> The electric car maker will no longer use chips from Nvidia to power its massive infotainment console, Bloomberg's Ian King first reported. Instead, Tesla will use chips supplied by Intel, the world's largest chipmaker.</p> <br>
      
       <p> The Model 3 and new versions of the Model X and Model S will rely on the Intel chips, according to the report. </p>
    
      <p>not much is known about the infotainment system, as it is top secret.</p>
      
      <p>If you get bored of navigating around planet Earth, Tesla lets you turn Google Maps into the surface of Mars.
        Hold down the Tesla logo on the screen and wait until it pulses, then when it asks for an access code type in 'Mars' and you'll see the screen transports you to the Red Planet</p>

<p>Have you ever felt as though your digital dashboard could do with a bit more colour? 
        By activating the Autopilot function four times in quick succession, the colour of the road displayed on screen changes colour from grey to a bright rainbow, and a snippet of Blue Öyster Cult’s Don’t Fear the Reaper plays in the background</p>

      <p>There’s a large team of people behind the development and production of every Tesla model, so it’s only fair that they have their own little Easter egg dedicated to them. 
        Pressing the Tesla icon at the top of the screen will reveal information about the car including the model name, but press the centre of the model name for a few seconds and the screen changes to display a group photo of the Model S development team</p>
